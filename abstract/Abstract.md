# Abstract (One Page)

This work proposes a quantum-enhanced framework for CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing that
combines **quantum DNA encoding**, **Grover’s search** for mutation detection, **machine learning**
for off-target classification, and **nanobot-assisted delivery** for targeted therapy. Quantum
superposition (Hadamard) and entanglement (CNOT) allow parallel analysis of candidate edits,
reducing the search cost compared to classical scans. Grover’s algorithm amplifies mutation
states, while classical ML (SVM) and deep learning (LSTM) score off-target risks. Finally, a
conceptual nanobot layer simulates payload release at the target based on molecular cues.

This repo includes runnable notebooks, a sample dataset schema, and clear instructions for
extending with large real datasets.
